* Daily flow

My main goal is having a tool to answer the questions:
- What did I accomplish, so far?
- What is blocked/waiting?
- What should I do next?
- Do I have any appointment?

- TIMESTAMP: It's an appointment. This item will happens at
- SCHEDULED means: I'd like to start at
- DEADLINE means: It should be finished at

** Start the day:
   1. Review messages at email/Slack to [[* Adding a new task][capture tasks]]
   2. C-c a a :: to Open org-agenda for review things scheduled for today
   3. C-c p p :: Select the project
   4. [[* Starting a new task][Start a task]]

*** Adding a new task
    1. C-c c (org-capture)
    2. Select note type
    3. Fill the blanks

*** Starting a new task
    1. C-c a (org-agenda) a
    2. Point cursor over the desired task and hit t
    3. Select s, for STARTED, in the prompt.
    4. Go to work ;)

*** Classifing captured tasks
    2. C-c a a :: to Open org-agenda for review unclassified tasks
    2. Go to the first caputured task
    3. C-c C-w (org-refile) : refile the task to the correct org file


** Finish the day
   1. Open agenda
